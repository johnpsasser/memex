This document explains how to effectively use the documentation system and contribute changes.

## Documentation Philosophy

### Token Efficiency Principle

The documentation system is designed to minimize token usage for AI agents:

- **Keyword-based discovery** - Find what you need without reading everything
- **Hierarchical loading** - Load only specific sections via anchor links
- **Cross-referenced** - Navigate between related concepts efficiently
- **Minimal redundancy** - Each concept documented once, referenced everywhere

### The Three-Tier System

```
1. GLOSSARY.md (entry point)
   |-- Keyword index
   |-- Topic groupings
   +-- Quick reference tables

2. Specialized Documentation
   |-- core/          <- Architecture, database, API
   |-- features/      <- Feature-specific docs
   +-- operations/    <- Deployment, troubleshooting

3. Master Reference
   +-- CLAUDE.md      <- Quick instructions for Claude Code
```

**Rule of Thumb:** Start with GLOSSARY.md, load specific sections, fall back to CLAUDE.md only when needed.

## How to Use Documentation

### Step 1: Search the Glossary

Always start here: `docs/GLOSSARY.md`

Example workflow:
```
Task: "Fix database query issue"

1. Open GLOSSARY.md
2. Search for: "query"
   -> Found: query -> docs/core/DATABASE.md#queries
3. Load specific section: docs/core/DATABASE.md#queries
4. Find the relevant query patterns
```

### Step 2: Load Specific Sections

Use markdown anchor links to jump directly to relevant sections:

```markdown
# Instead of reading entire file
Read: DATABASE.md (full file)

# Load specific section only
Read: DATABASE.md#queries (just that section)
```

### Step 3: Cross-Reference Properly

When you find information, check cross-references:

```
Found in CLAUDE.md:
  "See docs/core/DATABASE.md#queries for details"

Action: Load docs/core/DATABASE.md#queries
```

## When to Update Documentation

### New Features

**Rule:** If you add a feature, update documentation BEFORE committing code.

Required updates:

1. **GLOSSARY.md** - Add keywords for discoverability
2. **Specialized doc** - Add detailed implementation
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Update if it affects key files or constraints

### Architecture Changes

**Trigger:** Changes to service topology, data flow, or system boundaries

**Update:** `docs/core/ARCHITECTURE.md` AND affected specialized docs

### API Changes

**Trigger:** New endpoints, changed signatures, deprecated routes

Update locations:
1. `docs/core/API.md` - Add endpoint documentation
2. `GLOSSARY.md` - Add keywords
3. `CLAUDE.md#key-files` - If creates new critical route file

## Documentation Patterns

### Use Markdown Headers for Sections

Headers automatically create anchor links:

```markdown
## Main Section       -> #main-section
### Subsection        -> #subsection
#### Detail Level     -> #detail-level
```

### Keep Code Examples Concise

Show only relevant parts, not full file dumps.

### Use Tables for Reference Data

Tables are easy to scan and consume few tokens.

### Include "Key Files" Sections

Help agents locate relevant code quickly with file paths and line numbers.

## Git Workflow

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
feat: Add new feature
fix: Fix bug
docs: Update documentation
refactor: Restructure code
test: Add tests
```

### Pre-Commit Checklist

- [ ] Code compiles
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated (GLOSSARY.md + specialized docs)
- [ ] No console.log left in production code

---

## Summary

1. **Start with GLOSSARY.md** for keyword lookup
2. **Load specific sections** via anchor links
3. **Update docs as you code** - not after
4. **Follow established patterns** in existing docs
